  {
    question: "When can I start applying?",
    answer: `Your school will give you a code to register an account to OUAC. You can expect it by the end of November, but usually between late October to early November.`,
  },
  {
    question: "How many programs should I apply to?",
    answer: `If you are confident about the field/program you want to enter, 4-5 is optimal - 2 reaches, 2 target, and a safety. If you are not sure about your path, you may need to apply to more to keep your options open.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Do rankings matter?",
    answer: `It depends on your field. Rankings are often based on graduate research output and may be useful for entry to graduate/professional programs like medicine or law. For other sciences, arts, or engineering, prioritize programs with a good co-op system (such as Waterloo).`,
  },
  {
    question: "When can I expect to hear back from these universities?",
    answer: `Varies wildly from program to program. You can receive decisions as early as November, but it isn't uncommon to hear back by the end of May (especially true for competitive programs).`,
  },
  {
    question: "How do early decisions work?",
    answer: `In Ontario, "early decision" isn't a separate process you apply for. If a program has early rounds, you may apply earlier to be considered for these.`,
  },
  {
    question: "What is the 'Top 6' average?",
    answer: `Universities calculate your admission average using your best 6 Grade 12 U/M courses. This typically must include English and any prerequisite courses required by your program.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Do Grade 11 marks matter?",
    answer: `Early admission offers (before February) are often based on Grade 11 marks and your first semester Grade 12 marks. However, final offers are based on your Grade 12 average.`,
  },
  {
    question: "What are supplementary applications?",
    answer: `Some competitive programs require additional essays, videos, or interviews beyond your OUAC application. Check each program's requirements carefully - deadlines may differ from the OUAC deadline.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Can I defer my admission?",
    answer: `Most universities allow deferrals for one year, but policies vary. Contact the admissions office of your specific program to understand their deferral policy and any conditions.`,
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I don't meet the conditional offer requirements?",
    answer: `If your final marks drop significantly below your conditional offer requirements, your offer may be rescinded. Contact the university immediately if you're concerned - they may work with you depending on the circumstances.`,
