    question: "When can I start applying?",
    answer: `Your school will give you a code to register an account to OUAC. You can expect it by the end of November, but usually between late October to early November.
      `,
  },
  {
    question: "How many programs should I apply to? ",
    answer: `If you are confident about the field/program you want to enter, 4-5 is optimal - 2 reaches, 2 target, and a safety. 
      If you are not sure about your path, you may need to apply to more to keep your options open. `,
  },
  {
    question: "Do rankings matter?",
    answer: `It depends on your field. Rankings are often based on graduate research output and may be useful for entry to graduate/professional programs like medicine or law.
      For other sciences, arts, or engineering, prioritize programs with a good co-op system (such as Waterloo). `,
  },
  {
    question: "When can I expect to hear back from these universities?",
    answer: `Varies wildly from program to program. You can recieve decisions as early as November, but it isnt uncommon to hear back by the end of May (especially true for competitive programs).      `,
  },
  {
    question: "How do early decisions work?",
    answer: `In Ontario, "early decision" isn't a seperate process you apply for. If a program has early rounds, you may apply earlier to be considered for these.`,
